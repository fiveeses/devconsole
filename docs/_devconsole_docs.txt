devconsole (index.js)
{
   init,       (function(forElement, className, notPromise))
   Processor   (class)
}

init (forElement, className, notPromise)
   forElement (HTML Element to tack the console onto)
   className (optional class name to put on the console)
   notPromise - by default, the init will result in a promise which resolves to the console
                  but if notPromise is true, it'll directly return the console

dc (HTML Element with extra abilities)
   <HTMLElement members>

   addTab
   toggle


Processor should be loaded up with utilities, and MainProcessor should be created in dc.init.core

addTab({ execute, element, title})
   element (optional -- will make "article" if unspecified)
   title - name of the tab to be created
   execute - 

   execute is presently unused :(
   There's a TODO in tabs init
   will need either:
      * processor 
      * commands (will result in the creation of a commandtable processor) 
      * executor (execute - will result in a processor which uses this exe)

// what happens currently?
+ keypress all entry is fine except tilde which gets 
   screened because it switches tabs
+ keyup - enter does envelope execute (set in init core)

execute
  executeMain
    (catch) executeInActiveTab
  executeInActiveTab

   all go to execute in tab

      runs tab.execute or reject if no tabs

      tab does not have exe because nothing gets added yet




// init
   envelope { }
   
   dc = make HTML  (just DOM, no fn)
      + envelope.outer=dc
   
   append dc to target

   createTabs
      + dc.addTab
   
   initializeTextInput
            > input--ESC---->outer.toggle()
            > input--ENTER-->envelope.execute()

   initializeCore
      + dc.toggle
            > envelope.execute
